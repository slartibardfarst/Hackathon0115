Hackathon (January 2015)

Photo Matching
--------------

Inspired by: [Blog](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html)

Given two images and determing their percentual hash values, we can use hamming distance to compare them.
A hamming distance of 0 would indicate both images are very similar.
